1. Always use minimal pointers for computation.

2. Whenever their is manipulation related to two List , it is always better to use dummyNode .

3. Becareful , if you initialize temporary node in the middle of while loop . 
   Because it may lead to NullPointerException .

4. While writing program for Linked List always keep a loop that prints the 
   linked list . 
   So , it becomes easy to debug the output .Or, while writing the code return 
   head again and again so that you come to know how the list is manipulated .

5. While writing code be careful about "Null Pointer Exception" . Specially when 
   you hit end of the list .
