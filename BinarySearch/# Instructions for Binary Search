# Instructions for Binary Search

1. In binary search , even if target value is not present
   while binary search . At the end , mid value will fall 
   somewhere where the target value can be inserted .


2. While applying binary search never think to divide the 
   value by 2 before sending to Binary Search . Because
   binary search is ultimately going to partition that .

3. If we need to find A+B+C+D = 0 but
   doing so will take O(N^4) because of 4 for loops .
   So , if we do A + B = - (C + D) then time complexity 
   will be O(N^2) + O(N^2) = O(N^2) . Which is better .
