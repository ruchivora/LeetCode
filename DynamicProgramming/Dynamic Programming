Dynamic Programming : 

1. When to use Dynamic Programming ?
   - Decision based problem and the answer required is Optimal .

2. What is Dynamic Programming ? 
   - Recursion + Memoization 

3. How to write recursion ?
 	- Base Condition 
 	- Choice 

4. How to find base condition for recursion ? 
	- Think about the smallest input and then find , what
	  will be the answer of that smallest input .

5. How to write Recursive Equation ?
    - Learn to draw decision tree .
    - While writing recursive solution alays think about 
      what are the decisions to be made .

6. How to get Dynamic Solution of a problem ? 
	- Convert recursive solution to dynamic solution .

7. Why do you convert Recursive solution to Dynamic Approach ?
   -  Because Recursive approach are time consuming and may 
      also lead to stack overflow , So we convert recursive
      Solution to Dynamic Approach . 

8. How to convert Recursive Solution to Dynamic Approach ?
   - The base case of recursive solution becomes the initialization
     condition for the DP matrix , and then choice condition of 
     recursion is used to fill elements of DP matrix .

9. Tips for solving DP Problem .
	- While writing Recursion always write by considering
	  array index n as arr.length and not starting from 0 .

10. What are the various patterns of Dynamic Programming ?
      1. 0/1 Knapsack 
      2. Unbounded Knapsack 
      3. Longest common Subsequence 

11. How to find which pattern does the given problem belong to ?
      1. Match the input 
      2. Match the output
