Various Algorithms for solving Questions of Array .

1. Majority Element : Moore Voting Algorithm .
		- Majority Element
		- N/3 Repeat Number 

2. Sliding Window : Can be used for finding sum and product .
   But sliding window can not be used if the array element
   is negative .
        - Subarray Product Less than k 
        - Subarray sum ( Only positive numbers ) 

3. Two pointer approach . 

4. Decision Tree . Write recurrance and convert it to DP .

5. Cumulative Sum approach . 
		- Subarray sum equals K
