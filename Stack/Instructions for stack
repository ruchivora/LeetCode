When to use stack datastructure ?

1. Stack is frequently used to balance brackets , 
   to perform operation on string (like : remove
   duplicates ) , next greater element .

2. Whenever something is related to braces , first
   thought should be stack .

3. If you solve a problem by brute force and 
   Time Complexity is O(N2) , and their is 
   dependancy between the two loops . Then
   the time complexity can surely be reduced by 
   Stack. 
   eg: for( int i = 0 ; i < n ; i++ )
   			for( int j = i ; j < n ; j++ )
   	   Here their is dependency between the 
   	   two Loops , this can be optimized by Stack .
